## Make Money Clicker Game

### How to Play

Welcome to the Make Money Clicker Game! In this addictive and fun idle clicker game, your goal is to amass virtual wealth and become a millionaire. Here's how you can play:

**Step 1: Download and Extract**

- Start by downloading the game files from the repository. You can do this by clicking the "Download ZIP" button on the repository's main page.

- Once the download is complete, extract the contents of the ZIP file to your preferred location on your computer. This will create a folder containing the game files.

**Step 2: Run the Game**

- To play the game, you need to have Python installed on your computer. If you don't already have Python, you can download it from the official Python website at [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

- We recommend using a code editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to run the game. While we've tested the game on Visual Studio Code, it should work with other Python-friendly IDEs as well.

- Open your chosen code editor or IDE and navigate to the folder where you extracted the game files.

- Locate the `make_money_clicker_stable.py` file and open it in your code editor.

- Run the game by executing the Python script. In Visual Studio Code, you can do this by right-clicking the file and selecting "Run Python File in Terminal" or using the terminal with the `python make_money_clicker_stable.py` command.

**Step 3: Click to Earn Money**

- In the game interface, you'll see a "Click to Earn Money" button. Click on this button repeatedly to earn money. Each click will add to your wealth.

**Step 4: Buy Upgrades**

- As you accumulate wealth, you can purchase upgrades that increase your income per click. Visit the "Upgrades" tab to see the available upgrades and their costs. Click on an upgrade to buy it and enhance your earnings.

**Step 5: Prestige**

- Once you've amassed a significant amount of money, consider prestige. Prestiging resets your progress but grants you a bonus that accelerates your earnings. It's a strategic move to become even richer.

### Known Bugs
